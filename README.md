# Imputer

## We create the Imputer file to use the class and instance notion. First , we created a class called Imputer and added 2 different methods to replace missing values by the average or the median.

## The average is a measure that is sensitive to outliers and so we concluded that it was not the best measure . That is why we opted for the median which is more logical and is not sensitive to extreme values.
